This is a simple app in which you can:
- find a book in Google Books
- add a book from Google Books (you can import books from first 10 results from Google Books)
- add a book by form (if you can't find a book in Google Books you can add it by simple form)
- search a book in your added books

I use:
- Python
- Django
- PostgreSQL
- requests (for Google Books API)
